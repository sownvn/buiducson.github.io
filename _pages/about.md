  <h2>Biography</h2>

  <p><span class="bio-highlight">Bui Duc Son</span> is a Ph.D. student and Associate Researcher at the 
  <a href="https://wireless.skku.edu/main/bbs_list.php?unsingcode1=1715440655&unsingcode2=1715441006&unsingcode3=1715441061&code=research_c" target="_blank">
  Wireless Communications Laboratory (WCL)</a>, Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU), under the supervision of 
  <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=v2chr7kAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">Prof. Dong In Kim</a>. 
  He is pursuing a combined Master’s and Doctoral degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering, focusing on 
  wireless communications, distributed RIS-aided MIMO systems, and AI-driven network optimization.</p>

  <p>He received his B.S. degree in Electronics and Telecommunications from Hanoi University of Science and Technology (HUST) with a GPA of 3.48/4.0. From 2022 to 2025, he worked as a Research Assistant at NETLAB, HUST, under the supervision of Dr. Trinh Van Chien, where he conducted research on AI-enabled wireless communication systems. In 2023, he joined Viettel High Technology as a participant in the “Viettel Digital Talent 2023” program, developing 5G performance monitoring tools and BLER analysis solutions.</p>

  <p>His research has been published in leading IEEE venues, including <em>IEEE Communications Letters</em>, 
  <em>IEEE Internet of Things Journal</em>, <em>IEEE Wireless Communications Letters</em>, and 
  <em>IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials</em>. His recent work focuses on adversarial attacks and defenses 
  for RIS-MIMO systems over double-scattering channels, robust AI-based communication system design, and 
  graph neural networks for next-generation IoT.</p>

  <p>Son has received multiple awards, including the <strong>Australia-Vietnam Strategic Technologies Scholarship (2025)</strong>, 
  <strong>Second Prize in the National Science and Technology Awards for Students (2024)</strong>, and 
  <strong>First Prize at HUST’s 41st Scientific Research Student Conference</strong> in Network Security and Telecommunications (2024). 
  He also serves as a reviewer for <em>IEEE Internet of Things Journal</em> and IEEE PIMRC 2025.</p>
